# Instacart Market Analysis Using the Machine Learning Tools
## Abstract
Over the years, online shopping demand has increased tremendously. There are a variety of online retail stores opened in the last decade. As demand for online shopping is increased, the importance of analyzing customers’ patterns and purchasing habits is the key element to succeed in the industry and the improvement is done through the analysis such as introducing a recommendation system. Instacart is an online retail store that customer buys grocery online and it is delivered to his/her door. The company provides services in Canada and the United States and becomes one of the major players in the online grocery industry. Instacart provided open datasets available for academic purpose and the dataset has 3 million customer orders from 2017. The dataset contains product description, product list in each order, and the order with date and customer ID. I conduct machine learning approaches of customer segmentation analysis to find customers’ patterns and market basket analysis that leads to product recommendation. 
Techniques to solve the problem in the project are k-mean clustering, association rule, and collaborative filtering. The solution is implemented by Python in Colab and several Python libraries are used in this project: Apyori, Pandas, and Sklearn for machine learning tools, and Matplotlib and Seaborn are for data visualization.
